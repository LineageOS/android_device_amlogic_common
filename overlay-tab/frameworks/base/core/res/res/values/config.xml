    <!-- Flag indicating whether the current device is "voice capable".
         If true, this means that the device supports circuit-switched
         (i.e. voice) phone calls over the telephony network, and is
         allowed to display the in-call UI while a cellular voice call is
         active.  This can be overridden to false for "data only" devices
         which can't make voice calls and don't support any in-call UI.

         Note: this flag is subtly different from the
         PackageManager.FEATURE_TELEPHONY system feature, which is
         available on *any* device with a telephony radio, even if the
         device is data-only. -->

         receiving sms via the telephony network.
         This can be overridden to false for "data only" devices
         which can't send and receive sms message.

         Note: Disable SMS also disable voicemail waiting sms,
               cell broadcasting sms, and MMS. -->
